# Mizu Hamzazu

Landing page for the virtual streamer Mizu Hamzazu. React 19 + React Router + Vite + TypeScript.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # typecheck + production build into dist/
npm run preview    # serve dist/ locally
npm run lint
```

To test the production build with gzip on localhost (needs Python 3.10+):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm run build                       # also writes a .gz next to every text file in dist/
npm run serve                       # http://localhost:8000, uvicorn server.app:app
curl -sI -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' localhost:8000/en/   # shows content-encoding: gzip
```

## Deploy (Vercel)

Import the repo (`vercel.json` sets the Vite preset and adds cache and security headers; `.vercelignore` keeps the Python test server out). Vercel compresses responses itself (Brotli or gzip, whichever the browser asks for), so the `.gz` files are skipped there.
Set `VITE_SITE_URL` (for example `https://mizu.id`) in Project Settings, Environment Variables.
Without it the canonical URL, Open Graph image, `sitemap.xml` and JSON-LD URLs are skipped.

## Where things live

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Site name, links, handles, theme colour, share image | `src/config/site.ts` |
| Profile facts that are the same in every language (height, debut, birthday, fan name, socials, aliases). Empty values (like `illustrator` until it is known) are never published | `src/config/site.ts` (`profile`, `fanName`) |
| **All text**, in English, Japanese, Indonesian and Korean: UI labels, SEO title/description, bio, FAQ, emote names, form messages | `src/i18n/messages/{en,jp,id,kr}.ts` |
| Language list, URL codes (`/en/`, `/jp/`, `/id/`, `/kr/`), device-language detection, saved choice | `src/i18n/locales.ts`, `src/i18n/navigation.ts` |
| Routes (`/<locale>/`, `/<locale>/supports/`), redirect for URLs without a language | `src/App.tsx`, page slugs in `src/i18n/pages.ts`, sections in `src/pages/` |
| Per-language, per-page HTML files, meta tags, hreflang, JSON-LD, robots.txt (AI crawler rules), llms.txt, sitemap.xml, no-JS fallback HTML, the `/` language redirect | `vite/seoPlugin.ts` |
| Animations (GSAP + ScrollTrigger, reduced-motion aware: with reduced motion nothing animates and CSS shows the final look) | `src/lib/motion.ts`, `src/hooks/useGsap.ts`, `Reveal.tsx` |
| Membership tier badges | `TIER_LEVELS` in `FloatingBadges.tsx`, `public/membership/tier-1.webp` to `tier-6.webp` (1:1, replace the placeholders) |
| Clover and branch decorations | `Clover` / `Branch` in `Doodles.tsx`, `Garland.tsx`, `SectionHeading.tsx` |
| Emotes, hero art, first-paint images | `src/data/images.ts` |
| Stream schedule, supports data (structure only; the words are in `src/i18n/messages`) | `src/data/schedule.ts`, `src/data/supports.ts` |
| Loading screen markup + styles / logic | `index.html` (inline critical CSS; keep the `<!--locale-head-->` and `<!--locale-noscript-->` markers, the build fails without them) / `src/main.tsx` |
| Images (you supply them, they are not in git), all `.webp` | `public/emotes/<name>.webp`, `public/hero/<name>.webp`, `public/membership/tier-<n>.webp`, `public/og-image.webp` (1200x630), `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon.svg` |

When you add an emote or hero image, add its `.webp` file to `public/` and list it in `src/data/images.ts`.
The loading screen only waits for fonts and the hero images, downloaded and decoded (`src/main.tsx`, list in `src/data/images.ts`); everything else loads lazily.

## Languages

The site lives at `/en/`, `/jp/`, `/id/` and `/kr/`. `/` redirects to the visitor's saved choice, then their device language, then English.
The header menu switches language without a reload and remembers the choice.

- `src/i18n/messages/en.ts` is the source of truth. Add a key there and `npm run typecheck` lists every language that still needs it.
- Text with a value in it is a function, for example `iAm: (name) => ...`, so each language can put the value where its grammar wants it.
- To add a language: add its code to `LOCALES` and `localeInfo` in `src/i18n/locales.ts`, a `src/i18n/messages/<code>.ts` file, register it in `messages/index.ts`, and add its language subtag to `browserLanguageMap` in `src/i18n/locales.ts`.
- `npm run build` writes one file per language and page (`dist/<code>/index.html`, `dist/<code>/supports/index.html`) with its own title, meta tags and hreflang links (JSON-LD on the home page), so search engines see each language and a direct visit or refresh of any page finds a real file.
- To add a page: add it to `PAGES` and `SLUGS` in `src/i18n/pages.ts`, a `<Route>` in `src/App.tsx`, and its `seo` text in the messages.
- Stream titles in `src/data/schedule.ts` are the real YouTube titles and are not translated; their descriptions are.

## Conventions

- Motion: run GSAP only through `useGsap` (or check `prefersReducedMotion()`), so reduced motion shows the final static look.
- Styling: CSS Modules per component; colours and shadows come from the variables in `src/styles/global.css`, no hard-coded hex in modules.
- Fonts: only Latin subsets are bundled on purpose; kana, kanji and Hangul use the system fonts in `--font-cjk-fallback`.
- Dropdowns: never a native `<select>`; use `src/components/ui/Dropdown.tsx`.
- Platforms are looked up with `getPlatform()` from `src/config/site.ts`. Event handlers start with `handle`.
- Files stay together: a helper lives in the component that uses it until it is shared or the file passes ~250 lines.
